# Real-Time-Driver-Alertness-Detection-System
A deep learning–powered computer vision system that detects driver drowsiness in real time using facial cues such as eye closure duration, blinking patterns, and yawning frequency. Built using MobileNet, OpenCV, and Python, the system runs efficiently on standard hardware at 20–60 FPS.
